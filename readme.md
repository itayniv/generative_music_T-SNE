# Flocking TSNE is an experiment by [Ayal Rosenberg](http://www.ayalrosenberg.com/) & [Itay Niv](http://www.itayniv.com/)


This experiment displays a set of processed audio files in two dimensional space using the t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, placing similar-sounding audio clips near each other, and plays them back as autonomous flocking agents collide with them.

TSNE processed with the help of [Gene Kogan's](https://github.com/genekogan) [ML4A guids](https://ml4a.github.io/guides/).
Boids simulation heavily inspired by [p5JS Flocking](https://p5js.org/examples/simulate-flocking.html).
